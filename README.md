## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a hobbyist programmer in high school and college. I work primarily in Python, and I develop games, websites, and other fun applications. I'm active on the [Python Discord server](https://discord.gg/python).

### What I am working on
I'm developing a personal website over on [Anonymous4045.social](https://www.anonymous4045.social)!

### What I will work on next
I'm interested in the Rust programming language, so I'll likely develop some games and post them on my website.

### Want to contact me?
Send me an [email](mailto:contact@anonymous4045.social) and I will get back to you as soon as I can.
